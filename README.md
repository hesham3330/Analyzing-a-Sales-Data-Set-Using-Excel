# Analyzing-a-Sales-Data-Set-Using-Excel

In this project, I conducted a detailed sales performance analysis using Excel to derive valuable insights, such as Total Earnings, Top Consultant Sales Revenue, and Monthly Revenue Trends. I highlighted key performance areas, including the Highest, Lowest, and Average Monthly Revenues, ensuring that success could be tracked and underperformance addressed effectively.

With built-in slicers for factors like Sales Team, Training Models, and Monthly Sales, I provided dynamic data exploration that enabled actionable insights. Additionally, I tracked Revenue Contributions from Advertisement Campaigns and analyzed sales by Area Codes, which allowed for more targeted strategies.

Key Metrics for Business Growth
I also analyzed the data at a granular level, focusing on metrics such as Total Paid and Unpaid Calls, Training Models Fees, and Top Consultant Contributions. I visualized Advertising Spend by Channels and assessed their ROI, helping to optimize marketing strategies. The analysis also highlighted Top Performing Sales Teams, fostering a competitive, results-driven environment.

Design and Aesthetics
I applied a dark theme to enhance data readability while giving the dashboard a modern, professional look, making it suitable for presentations and reporting. This dashboard was designed as the perfect tool for businesses seeking a seamless blend of functionality and aesthetics
